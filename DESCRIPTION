Description: Clustering is carried out to identify patterns in
    transcriptomics profiles to determine clinically relevant subgroups
    of patients. Feature (gene) selection is a critical and an integral part
    of the process. Currently, there are many feature selection and clustering
    methods to identify the relevant genes and perform clustering of samples.
    However, choosing an appropriate methodology is difficult. In addition,
    extensive feature selection methods have not been supported by the
    available packages. Hence, we developed an integrative R-package called
    multiClust that allows researchers to experiment with the choice of
    combination of methods for gene selection and clustering with ease.
    Using multiClust, we identified the best performing clustering methodology
    in the context of clinical outcome. Our observations demonstrate that
    simple methods such as variance-based ranking perform well on the majority
    of data sets, provided that the appropriate number of genes is selected.
    However, different gene ranking and selection methods remain relevant
    as no methodology works for all studies.
