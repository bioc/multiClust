Description: Whole transcriptomic profiles are useful for studying the expression levels of thousands of genes across samples. Clustering algorithms are
                 used to identify patterns in these profiles to determine clinically relevant subgroups. Feature selection is a critical integral part of
                 the process. Currently, there are many feature selection and clustering methods to identify the relevant genes and perform clustering of
                 samples. However, choosing the appropriate methods is difficult as recent work demonstrates that no method is the clear winner. Hence, we
                 present an R-package called `multiClust` that allows researchers to experiment with the choice of combination of methods for gene selection
                 and clustering with ease. In addition, using multiClust, we present the merit of gene selection and clustering methods in the context of
                 clinical relevance of clustering, specifically clinical outcome. Our integrative R- package contains: 1. A function to read in gene
                 expression data and format appropriately for analysis in R. 2. Four different ways to select the number of genes a. Fixed b. Percent c.
                 Poly d. GMM 3. Four gene ranking options that order genes based on different statistical criteria a. CV_Rank b. CV_Guided c. SD_Rank d.
                 Poly 4. Two ways to determine the cluster number a. Fixed b. Gap Statistic 5. Two clustering algorithms a. Hierarchical clustering b.
                 K-means clustering 6. A function to calculate average gene expression in each sample cluster 7. A function to correlate sample clusters
                 with clinical outcome Order of Function use: 1. input_file, a function to read-in the gene expression file and assign gene probe names as
                 the rownames. 2. number_probes, a function to determine the number of probes to select for in the gene feature selection process. 3.
                 probe_ranking, a function to select for gene probes using one of the available gene probe ranking options. 4. number_clusters, a function
                 to determine the number of clusters to be used to cluster genes and samples. 5. cluster_analysis, a function to perform Kmeans or
                 Hierarchical clustering analysis of the selected gene expression data. 6. avg_probe_exp, a function to produce a matrix containing the
                 average expression of each gene probe within each sample cluster. 7. surv_analysis, a function to produce Kaplan-Meier Survival Plots of
                 selected gene expression data.
